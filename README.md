# GDB_Tutorial
Code and Notes to be used for a GDB tutorial. 


## Things to Cover  
- When to use it  
- How to get symbols into GDB  
- Breakpoints  
- Finding Segfaults  
- Step through code one line at a time 
- Stepping into code  
- Step through code one assembly command at a time  
- Different Layouts within GDB  
- Printing out values within GDB  
- Printing out registers within GDB  
- Looking at the Stack  
- Check for the change of a value (I think thats a thing) 
- PEDA has been used to help students in the assembly class, but I don't like it

## Materials Needed  
- Github Repo with all files necessary  
- Slides to help throughout tutorial 
- GDB CheatSheet  
- Makefile to run with one program at a time 
- C/C++ code that will be needed to show different situations for GDB  
	- Segfaults  
	- Incorrect output  
	- Reverse Engineering  
- Linux Enviornment  
- SSH into CCC Machine?
